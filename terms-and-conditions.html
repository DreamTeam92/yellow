                        <p>Your Massage Pro's cancellation policy is designed to protect me from lost business and costs that may be incurred from service arrangements. My policy is outlined below:</p> 
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I operate a 24-hour cancellation policy. By booking an appointment, the client is agreeing to the cancellation policy. Your time, as well as my time, is important. We realize that there are many things that can come up in people’s day to day lives. While truly sympathetic, when a client cancels without giving enough notice, they prevent another client from being seen. In fairness to all clients as well as to me, this policy is in effect regardless of the reason for the cancellation.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You can reschedule or cancel your appointment free of charge, with minimum 24 hour notice prior to your appointment. You can cancel or reschedule free of charge up to 24 hours in advance of the appointment. Any time within 24 hours of the appointment you will be charged the full cost of the appointment.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I offer a 15-minute grace period for customers in the instance of lateness for appointments. If you are more than 15 minutes late I have the right to leave the appointment location and you will be charged in full.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Whilst I always communicate with you, there are some unforeseeable circumstance that might mean I cannot turn up at the arranged time. If this happens, please contact me within 48 hours of your appointment time and I will refund you in full.</p>
